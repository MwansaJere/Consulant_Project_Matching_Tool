# Project Title


# Consultation Matching Tool 🧑‍💻🤝

### Project Description

This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to create a robust **consultation matching tool**. The tool connects consultants with the best-fit projects or clients by analyzing project descriptions, consultant expertise, and historical success rates. By optimizing the matching process, it ensures better alignment, maximizes consultant productivity, and enhances client satisfaction.

### Features 🌟

**NLP for Profile and Project Analysis**:

- Extracts key skills, expertise, and project requirements using advanced NLP techniques.

- Leverages keyword extraction, entity recognition, and text classification to understand profiles and descriptions.

**Recommendation System**:

- Matches consultants to projects using similarity scores based on cosine similarity or other distance metrics.

- Provides top-ranked matches with justification for each recommendation.

**Data Visualization**:

- Dashboards to display consultant and project metrics, including match success rates and skills gaps.

**Historical Data Analysis**:

- Learns from past projects and feedback to improve future recommendations.

**Automated Reporting**:

- Generates detailed reports summarizing match quality, project outcomes, and consultant performance.
